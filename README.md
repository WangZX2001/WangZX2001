- 👋 Hi, I’m @WangZX2001, a first-year Computer Engineering student at the National University of Singapore (NUS)🌱.  I’m passionate about robotics 😊 and enjoy working on projects that bring machines to life 🐱. During the holidays, I love creating my own personal robotics projects to explore new ideas 🤙. I believe robotics will play a huge role in shaping the future 🤖, from making our daily lives easier to helping solve global challenges🌍.
